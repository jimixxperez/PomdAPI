# Introduction

## PomdAPI 
**PomdAPI** is a Python library built to bring a **FastAPI-style** developer experience to creating strongly-typed API clients. 

We love the clarity and ergonomics FastAPI introduced for web apps, especially with its Pydantic-based approach. But when we needed a similar, no-nonsense way to define and manage multi-protocol API calls‚ÄîHTTP, JSON-RPC, XML-RPC‚Äîwe couldn‚Äôt find anything that ‚Äújust worked‚Äù without getting tangled in repetitive logic.

So we built PomdAPI with one simple goal:

deliver that same clean, efficient feeling to any kind of API interaction. Whether you prefer sync or async, need caching and invalidation, or want a clear, typed model for requests and responses, PomdAPI aims to make it all painless and Pythonic. We hope it becomes your go-to solution for taming multi-protocol APIs with minimal fuss.

## Why use PomdAPI?

 üéØ <strong class="vertical-middle"> Declarative Endpoints</strong><br>
Define your queries and mutations in a single, clear place using decorators. This means you can outline how to fetch or update data‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs GitHub issues or Ethereum balances‚Äîwithout repeating request logic.

üöÄ <strong class="vertical-middle"> Pluggable Protocols</strong><br>
Enjoy out-of-the-box support for HTTP, JSON-RPC, and XML-RPC calls, with a straightforward pattern for adding any custom protocol. All protocols share the same consistent API interface, so you can reuse logic and tooling across diverse data sources.

üîí <strong class="vertical-middle"> Built-In Caching</strong><br>
Built with Python type hints and Pydantic models, giving you both compile-time checks and runtime validation. This helps prevent bugs and ensures predictable data structures across your codebase.

‚ö° <strong class="vertical-middle"> Automatic Sync/Async</strong><br>
Use the same function in synchronous or asynchronous contexts‚Äîno code duplication necessary. Whether you‚Äôre in a simple script or an async-based web framework, the library adapts seamlessly.

üîñ <strong class="vertical-middle"> Tag-Based Invalidation</strong><br>
Speed up your application by reducing unnecessary requests and handling partial data updates. Choose from in-memory, Memcached, Redis, or implement your own custom caching backend.

üîñ <strong class="vertical-middle"> Expandable Architecture</strong><br>
Assign tags to endpoints, then invalidate entire lists or single items by tag. This makes cache updates straightforward and more maintainable for dynamic data.

Whether you‚Äôre building a small prototype or a large-scale service, these features help keep your code clean, consistent, and reliable. For more hands-on guides, check out our Getting Started page or explore the Examples of how you can integrate PomdAPI into real-world projects.

## Quick Start

!!! example "In Beta"
    PomdAPI is in early beta, the API might be still subject to change.


```python
from pomdapi.api.http import HttpApi, RequestDefinition
from pomdapi.cache.in_memory import InMemoryCache

# Create an API instance with in-memory caching
api = HttpApi.from_defaults(
    base_query_config=BaseQueryConfig(base_url="https://api.example.com"),
    cache=InMemoryCache()
)

# Define deserialized response type
class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    id_: str = Field(alias="id")
    name: str
    age: int

# Define a query endpoint
@api.query("getUserProfile", response_type=UserProfile)
def get_user_profile(user_id: str):
    return RequestDefinition(
        method="GET",
        url=f"/users/{user_id}"
    )


# Use the function in the default async context
async def main():
    profile = await get_user_profile(user_id="123") 
    print(profile)

# or in a sync context
def main():
    profile = get_user_profile(is_async=False, user_id="123")
    print(profile)
```

## FastAPI vs. PomdAPI: An Inversion

FastAPI is a server framework that uses parameter decorators to build endpoints. For example, you write code like:

=== "FastAPI"
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/item/{item_id}")
def read_user(item_id: int):
  ...
```

Here, FastAPI uses the function signature (e.g., item_id, q) to parse incoming requests, inject them as arguments, and produce a server response.

=== "PomdAPI"
```python
from pomdapi.api.http import HttpApi

api = HttpApi(...)

@api.query("getItem")
def get_item(item_id: str, q: str | None = None):
    return RequestDefinition(
        method="GET",
        url="/items/{item_id}",
    )
  )

```
PomdAPI, by contrast, does the client-side inverse. You define a function that takes parameters (like item_id, q), and the library uses them to build the outgoing request to a server

|   | FastAPI (Server) | PomdAPI (Client) |
|---|---|---|
| **What it does?** | Exposes a path like /items/{item_id}. The function runs when that path is requested. | Parametrizes a client call to that path (or another remote service). The function returns a ‚Äúrequest definition‚Äù that includes how to fetch or mutate data. |
| **Parameter usage** | Extract request parameters from path/query, injecting them into the function signature. | Use function parameters to dynamically build the request config‚ÄîURL, method, etc. The library then executes the request and returns (or caches) the response. |
| **Result** | A server-side function that runs for incoming requests. | A client-side function that makes requests to a remote server, with caching and tagging built-in. |



Conclusion

By removing the heavy lifting typically associated with data fetching and caching logic, this library lets you focus on delivering value to your users. It leverages a modular and type-friendly architecture, supports multiple transport protocols, and offers both sync and async flows to fit a variety of Python use cases‚Äîall in one cohesive package.
